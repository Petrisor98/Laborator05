# Laborator05

Three projects were implemented:
## StartedService 
- service that transmits values of different types (string, integer, vector) timed at a certain interval;
- these values are transmitted through broadcast intents throughout the Android operating system.

## StartedServiceActivity
- BroadcastReceiver for types of messages propagated through the operating system by the service;
- It displays these messages in the graphical interface through a text field.

## BoundedServiceActivity
- service that can interact with an activity through a method;
- the method provides a randomly selected string from a list of values.

## Smartphone
 - Device: [SM - J530F]
 - OS: [Android 9]

## Remarks
6. 
I checked the processes in the proc folder in Device File Explorer (Android Studio -> View -> Windows Tool -> Device File Explorer). The application started and stopped instant. If I restart the activity, I will obtain the following messages
- [x] 2021-04-01 14:08:58.292 4826-4826/? I/Process: Sending signal. PID: 4826 SIG: 9

If I try again it crashes and displays:
- [x] Process: ro.pub.cs.systems.eim.lab05.startedserviceactivity, PID: 4781
- [x] java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{ro.pub.cs.systems.eim.lab05.startedserviceactivity/ro.pub.cs.systems.eim.lab05.startedserviceactivity.view.StartedServiceActivity}: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not allowed to start service Intent { cmp=ro.pub.cs.systems.eim.lab05.startedservice/.service.StartedService }:app is in background uid null

9. 
I can't see the differences because the application is automatically stopped by the system Android phone. 

10.f  
If I press the HOME button and return, I notice that the messages generated by the service are still displayed on the phone screen. If I rotate the phone screen, then the previous messages aren't longer seen, the service is reset.

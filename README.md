Three projects were implemented:
## StartedService: 
- service that transmits values of different types (string, integer, vector) timed at a certain interval;
- these values are transmitted through broadcast intents throughout the Android operating system.

## StartedServiceActivity:
- BroadcastReceiver for types of messages propagated through the operating system by the service;
- It displays these messages in the graphical interface through a text field.

## BoundedServiceActivity:
- service that can interact with an activity through a method;
- the method provides a randomly selected string from a list of values.
